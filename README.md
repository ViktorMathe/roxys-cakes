# **Roxy's Cakes** 

I built this website for my wife's little business what she used to have. Roxy's Cakes is has been made to anybody who likes little treats or would like to surprise a relative or friend on any occasions. The customer can subscribe to the newsletter where they can get information about any new cakes which becomes available or any deals for example now the shop offer free delivery if they spend over Â£30. Anybody can find the shop on the [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/people/Roxys-Cakes/100090725342238/) as well (which might not be available due to the inactivity as this is just an educational site and the Facebook is remove it, in that case you can find a screenshot below). The customer can browse from different cakes and add them to the bag where you can process forward to the checkout page.
